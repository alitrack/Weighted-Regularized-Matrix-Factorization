## **Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization(WRMF)**  
Basic idea of Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF) is to assign smaller weights to the unobserved instances than the observed. The weights are related to the concept of confidence. As not interacting with an item can result from other reasons than not liking it, the zero values of  have low confidence. For example, a user might be unaware of the existence of the item, or unable to consume it due to its price or limited availability. Unobserved instances are a mixture of negative and unknown feedback.

 Also, interacting with an item can be caused by a variety of reasons that differ from liking it. For example, a  user may buy an item as gift for someone else, despite the user does not like the item. Thus it can be thought that there are also different confidence levels among the items that the user interacted with.

 A common objective function of WRMF which is to be minimized is formulated as follow. And several strategies for defining weight function  have been proposed.

 $$
L = \sum_{u \in U} \sum_{i \in I} w(u, i)
(y_{ui} - \boldsymbol{p}^T_u \boldsymbol{q}_i)^2 + \lambda _{U}
\sum_{u} \lVert  \boldsymbol{p}_u  \rVert^2  + \lambda _{I}
\sum_{i} \lVert  \boldsymbol{q}_i  \rVert^2
 $$
